This project needs extra libraries. They can be added via the Arduino IDE GUI.
<ol>In IDE 1.8.8 libraries are installed through the following sequence:
<li>IDE</li>
<li>Sketch</li>
<li>include libraries</li>
<li>manage library</li>
</ol>
It is instructive to investigate the TYPE field options and examine who contributed what !

Your source code often needs to contain an include line
include <libname.h> 
where libname is derived from the library name (mostly).
